# Every Matrix | Vending Machine

A simple imitation of the vending machine to buy fruits. Fruits are generated randomly on every page reload to imitate the device load stock of fruits.

Here's an example of the view of the fruit:

```bash
Watermelon - the name of the fruit
E32C - Code of the fruit
$2.00 / 1 - Price / Count of the fruit
```

Also, the machine has two keyboards:

1. To enter the fruit code
2. To fill the credit
